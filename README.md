### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pooya Shams kolahi and I'm a student of Allame-helli highschool in Tehran, Iran.

here are some of my coolest projects:
- [massspring](https://github.com/pooya-shams/massspring) : A physical simulator.
- [face-tracker](https://github.com/pooya-shams/face-tracker) : A simple assistant for scrolling through pages only moving your head. (no hands required!)
- [Digi-Board](https://github.com/pooya-shams/Digi-Board) : An open-source breadboard simulator used to predict the outcome of circuits without wiring them in real world. (A collaboration with my friend [Ali Mozdian](https://github.com/AliMozdian))

I'm currently busy with school. That means all of these projects are abandoned for now, but all pull requests are welcome Although I might not check them so frequently. If you have created a pull request to any of my repositories please be patient, I will review it one day.


Have a nice time
